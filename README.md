# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Learning Repository

Welcome to my NLP learning repository! üéì

This repository is a personal collection of notes, tutorials, and experiments as I explore various topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It‚Äôs not tied to any specific project but rather serves as a knowledge hub while I work through key NLP concepts and techniques.

## üìö Topics Covered
I will be covering (or have covered) a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal
- **Word Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, Transformers
- **Language Models**: BERT, GPT, and their variants
- **Text Classification**: Sentiment analysis, spam detection
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Machine translation, text summarization
- **Speech Processing**: Automatic speech recognition
- **Dialog Systems and Chatbots**

## üîß Tools and Libraries
The following libraries are utilized in the code and experiments:
- `NLTK`
- `spaCy`
- `Hugging Face Transformers`
- `Gensim`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `TensorFlow/PyTorch`

## üöÄ How to Use
Feel free to clone the repository if you'd like to follow along with my learning process, run the code, or reference any of the materials. You can use the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/sree-sivani/nlp-learning.git
```

## üìù Contributions
This repository is focused on personal learning, so contributions are currently not open. However, feel free to raise issues or suggest resources!
